(WIP: expect bugs and the like.)
This mod aims to add most, if not all elements of the periodic table to Factorio. Complex new production chains to refine and produce new ores and resources for your growing factory, and delving deeper into chemistry and production chains than a normal vanilla playthrough.

Sift through new "group ores", containing the elements of each separate periodic group (Alkali Metals, Transition Metals, etc) which can be broken down using new fluids or items to get a specific new resource, all in the name of expansion. Of course, not all elements can just be found in the ground; you'll have to sift through air, sea and ground to get everything you need to build further and research more.

# Features
* Complete revamp of circuit recipes, now needing breadboards, wires and integrated circuits to create usable electronics. And, of course, the higher the tier, the more complex the recipe.

* Multiple alternative recipes added for items, for more flexibility in your factory.

* Bio-Modules: a way to upgrade yourself using artificially-made genes and chemically-sounding words that can improve your HP, reach distance and speed.

* [OBLIGATORY] 50+ buildings for you to make stupidly big malls for!

* [OBLIGATORY] 500+ recipes for you to endlessly scroll through, like you do on social media!

* Whole buncha recipe complexity, or your money back.

* Separated technologies at an earlier stage, so you can pick and choose what you want to unlock without needing to get every science pack at 60SPM.

* Complete lack of maturity.

* Complete overhaul of petrochem (just like every other overhaul) and oil processing, separating crude oil into 8 fractions that each have their own uses.

* More ways to get resources than just "find patch", instead having specific buildings/items that can get specific resources (like gaseous elements).

* Multiple and unique ore/element processing steps, while still having copy-pastable builds.

* Expansion of vanilla recipes and products, e.g lubricant being tiered and being a more in-depth recipe chain.
