Version: 0.6.500
Date: 2024-12-08
  The Update:

  Additions:
    - Added Magnesium.
    - Added Strontium.
    - Added Barium.
    - Added Radium.
    - Added tier 3 solar panels and solar panel equipment.
    - Added a way to create calcium sulfate. Im a merciful dictator, after all.
    - Added RTG's, a small but expensive building that can take radioactive materials and turn them into power. Has a small neighbour bonus.
    - Added mixing tanks, a new 5x5 building that handles making things like sludges and slurries. Enjoy revamping your factory, suckers!
    - (This is where .133's oil residual line would have been, but i had to move that into public due to the sheer shittery of oil)
    - Added ignored_by_stats to voiding/looping/loop voiding recipes.
    - Added express long/bulk/inserters, unlocked at P-TM science. Express inserters are all 1.5x faster then their predecessor. All express inserters (long/bulk/normal) take their original inserter.
    - Added another intermediate to vacuum tubes, a vacuum tube getter - which takes caesium, rubidium, tungsten and zirconina.
    - Added a way to make bismite with flux, because i got rid of the original recipe which took flux.
    - Added a new way to deal with ferrum and patina unlocked at A-ATM science, allowing you to make waste water which can be seperated into some ores or just looped away.
    - Continuing to rerender and model ores and other things.
    - Finally made the patina recipe unlockable at advanced byproduct handling.
    - Changed reactors to require some kind of coolant to actually function - and will explode if they arent getting any liquid, and have fuel inside of them. Have fun!
    - Finally solved the whole issue of "hey theres no *real* way to make sulfur", by letting you make sulfur from sulfuric acid.
    - Revamped aluminium, moving it to A-ATM packs (under mixing tanks), and lenthenging the processing chain for it.
    - Added tier 3 solar panel equipment, with 90kW charge.
    - Added a new technology unlocked after platinum processing, moving ammonium chloride seperation down to A-ATM science.
    - Added 2 new types of beacons unlocked at AEM science, hub and proximity beacons. Hub beacons are wide and large beacons that can handle a lot of modules, but have a low distribution range. Proximity beacons are the opposite.
    - Added the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia, unlocked at metalloid packs.
    - Added an advanced iron processing chain that takes 4 steps, but has a 1:6 chunk to ore ratio compared to 1:2.

  Changes:
    - Changed CRT's recipe to take CRT framing and screens.
    - Moved around the items needed in CRT/Oscilliscopes/RCU's.
    - Made Oscilliscopes slightly cheaper. Slightly. (this line is now useless, spoilers, they are gone)

    - Changed molten-inators to start from 10 pollution/m, and gets to 6p/m at tier 3.
    - Changed calcite filtering to take 4 seconds instead of 1.3.

    - Changed modules to take 4 rubber instead of 2.
    - Nerfed stone walls resistances to 2% acid, 10% and 65% fire.
    - Changed electric mining drills 2 to be just upgraded tier 1's, without the increased mining area.
    - Deleted zirconium ore. It literally did nothing, and zirconium is already convulted as is with its uses.
    - Made crucibles need 3 zironica, compared to 2.
    - Made crucibles need 4 aluminium plates, compared to 2.
    - Changed the amount of acidic water you get from leeching ferrum/patina from 15 to 12.5, and made it a probability-based amount.
    - Changed the amount of polonium you can get from lead-solder, from 0-2, to 0-2 with a 25% chance. I still want to see people attempt to power their base with it.
    - Changed any plates that come after P-TM science, to take 6.4s instead of the usual 3.2s.
    - Changed palladium catalysts to use plates, not ore.
    - Lowered the cost of worker robots speed 5 technology from 500 to 450.
    - Changed the amount of electric engines needed for assembler 3's from 5 to 2.
    - lowered the amount of radiation framing need in assembler 3's from 10 to 5.
    - Changed yellow inserters to take gears, changed blue inserters to take yellow inserters.
    - Added productivity to lithium hydroxide and oversaturated lithium leeching.
    - Revamped battery charging by lowering the stack size of batteries, adding a chance for it to not give a charged battery out and a way to fix said batteries.
    - Moved empty bio-modules and actual bio-modules into their own subgroup.
    - Changed all slugs stack size to 100, and geneva neglection's to 150.
    - Changed slugs range deviation to be less on higher tiers, to make them more precise to use weapons and lowered the max amount of deviation on the 'worst' type of slug.
    - Changed TWAT's stack size to 50 instead of 20.
    - Made vacuum tubes slightly cheaper, by lowering the amount of resources compared to their original recipe.
    - Changed the first plastic science technology to also take R-NM packs.
    - Deleted oscilliscopes and merged them into RCU's, since there was no use for them being their own thing.
    - Changed RCU's to take 35 seconds, instead of 30 seconds.
    - Slightly lowered the amount of ferrum that is produced by most elements.
    - Changed assembler 3's to take 1 coolant instead of cooling plating.
    - Made evaporators much cheaper, and easier to make - now taking 4 ingredients instead of 6.
    - Changed white and black tin mixing to be in the chemical plant, and not an assembling machine.
    - Moved chlorine processing to behind red science, to make it more obvious for players.
    - Moved sodium hydroxide to waste water (A-ATM science), instead of being unlocked at crystallisation.
    - Deleted the sodium sodium hydroxide recipe.
    - Deleted the recipe to turn acidic water into sulfuric acid.
    - Deleted the alternative recipe for fiberoptic cable.
    - Changed CO2 nullifying to take 200 packs instead of 100.

    - Changed vanadium equipment MK1's to discharge 500kW, and MK2's to discharge 1MW.
    - Changed titanium chloride into the fluid, instead of an item.
    - Changed iron/copper/zinc/nickel TM leeching recipes to take 8 TM ore, instead of 12.
    - Reverted chromic ferrum/patina recipes to their old versions, but changed the constant 4 ore to 2-4.
    - Changed normal beacons to have 3 module slots.
    - Changed normal beacons to have 1 distribution effectivity, instead of 1.5.
    - Moved trace gas ammonia into its own technology.

  Fixes:
    - Fixed the science pack item names captilisation.
    - (Mostly) Fixed the Factoriopedia being a mess. Never not name your recipes after their outputs.
    - Fixed empty reactor cells taking 0.5s to craft, and not 20s. Sucks to suck, huh?
    - Finally got rid of the plastic bar item that appears in the factoriopedia and item menus.
    - Re-ordered science to actually be in the correct order (normal > plastic > francium)
    - Fixed the ordering of certain subgroups, for real this time.
    - Fixed random things like explosives not being in the presumably correct category.
    - Made slugs actually work with 2.0, im not sure how well they now work so any balance or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
    - Changed byproduct handling to be unlockable from ezekiel processing, and not transition metal leeching.
    - Added the heavy lubricant recipe of solar cells to lubricant technology.
    - Fixed ezekiel ore leeching to actually give the correct amount of ore. This hurts you more then it hurts me, i assure you.
