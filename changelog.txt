Version: 0.6.500
Date: 2024-12-08
  The Update:

  Additions:
    - Added Magnesium.
    - Added Strontium.
    - Added Barium.
    - Added Radium.
    - Added tier 3 solar panels and solar panel equipment.
    - Added a way to create calcium sulfate. Im a merciful dictator, after all.
    - Added RTG's, a small but expensive building that can take radioactive materials and turn them into power. Has a small neighbour bonus.
    - Added mixing tanks, a new 5x5 building that handles making things like sludges and slurries. Enjoy revamping your factory, suckers!
    - (This is where .133's oil residual line would have been, but i had to move that into public due to the sheer shittery of oil)
    - Added ignored_by_stats to voiding/looping/loop voiding recipes.
    - Added express long/bulk/inserters, unlocked at P-TM science. Express inserters are all 1.5x faster then their predecessor. All express inserters (long/bulk/normal) take their original inserter.
    - Added another intermediate to vacuum tubes, a vacuum tube getter - which takes caesium, rubidium, tungsten and zirconina.
    - Added a way to make bismite with flux, because i got rid of the original recipe which took flux.
    - Added a new way to deal with ferrum and patina unlocked at A-ATM science, allowing you to make waste water which can be seperated into some ores or just looped away.
    - Continuing to rerender and model ores and other things.
    - Finally made the patina recipe unlockable at advanced byproduct handling.
    - Changed reactors to require some kind of coolant to actually function - and will explode if they arent getting any liquid, and have fuel inside of them. Have fun!
    - Finally solved the whole issue of "hey theres no *real* way to make sulfur", by splitting up the chains to make sulfuric acid and sulfur. acid takes SO2, sulfur takes H2S
    - Revamped aluminium, moving it to A-ATM packs (under mixing tanks), and lenthenging the processing chain for it.
    - Added tier 3 solar panel equipment, with 90kW charge.
    - Added a new technology unlocked after platinum processing, moving ammonium chloride seperation down to A-ATM science.
    - Added 2 new types of beacons unlocked at AEM science, hub and proximity beacons. Hub beacons are wide and large beacons that can handle a lot of modules, but have a low distribution range. Proximity beacons are the opposite.
    - Added the Haber-Bosch process for ammonia, unlocked at metalloid packs.
    - Added an advanced processing chain for iron, copper, nickel, zinc and manganese. The chunk ores have a 1:6 chunk to ore ratio compared to 1:2.
    - Added beryllium plates instead of making it ore only, just because plates have been neglected recently.
    - Added mod settings for PM! Ranging from things like how fast bots are (0.25x - 2x), the amount of module slots certain buildings can have, etc
    - Added 2 new alternative recipes for LDS, using the 2 other main 'light' metals.
    - Added a way to get certain chemicals from bacteria'ed and cyanobacteria'ed agars, by feeding them another chemical.
    - Added entity descriptions for all heat pipes, displaying their max temperature.
    - Began modelling plates, and giving different elements different shapes compared to the default square.
    - Added a way to void calcium ore/dust/calcite.
    - FINALLY added electric boilers, so you dont need fuel everywhere when needing steam. (or just.. make steam trains, you nerds)
    - Added primary production recipes of hydrogen, instead of having every recipe it appears in having it be a byproduct.
    - Added syngas, which can be produced from oil recipes or made from carbon.
    - Changed it so that certain buildings (greenhouses, bacteria incubators) cannot be used if there is too much pollution in the same chunk as them.
    - Also changed it so that certain buildings (air filterers) now require to be in polluted chunks.
    - Overhauled the production of the 4 starter metals (iron, copper, nickel, zinc). They now take two steps to produce instead of one, and cannot be made from TM ores anymore.
    - Added a building dedicated to making coolant, so that it can be prioritised in power, and not cause your base to explode. Once again, merciful god.
    - Added I.S.S.Y - a spiderling that is built around its movement capabilities. It has low offensive capabilites, a slightly smaller equipment grid compared to its predeccessor - but is a lot faster. It has a discharge defense and a submachine gun built into it.
    - Added bonus techs for beacon distribution.
    - Added more borosilicate versions of recipes. (module lights, TWATS, reactor cells, etc)
    - Added bio-module upgrades 4-6. This'll probably be the max amount of upgrades you'll be able to get.
    - Added a kova recipe for francium.
    - Added tintable centrifuges - credit to NullPointerExempt's mod for the code and graphics!
    - Finally added hydrogen sulfide after ignoring it for ages, it'll be used even more soon!
    - Let more fluids be burnable in the burn-inator like ammonia, sulfur dioxide/trioxide, etc
    - Added a washing plant 3. Holy telescopic compactness batman!
    - Added another tier of roboports and alternative types, that allow you to diversify your bot malls.
    - Added a batch-recipe of copper tin solder, unlocked at alkaline metals.
    - Added magnesium-incendiary rockets, which when hitting something leave a magnesium fire on the ground that lasts for a while.
    - Changed circuit megassembler (and any subsequent MEGA buildings) to use themselves as modules - every single building put into them makes the placed building work as multiple. (if you place 2 buildings into a MEGA building, it works as 3, for example).
    - Added solid mercury, as a better way to transport it without piping it around to new silver/gold set-ups.
    - Added compatability with the Stack Inserter mod! the final two tiers of belt stacking bonus technologies arent finished, but should be fully implemented by 0.9
    - Also added native support for belt stacking, which'll work largely the same as the Stack Inserter mod.
    - Implemented octane fuel canisters, which act as advanced versions of the existing fuel canisters. Two of them exist, Vehicle and Industrial; naptha/kerosene make industrial and diesel/petrol make vehicle.
    - Added longer-handed inserters, to deal with bigger and bigger recipes!
    - Added a new achievement for using a combat bot.
    - Added a new type of damage, Penetrative, which is used by shotgun shells/slugs or genevas neglection ammo. smaller biters and nests are weaker to it, while spitters and worms are resistant to it.
    - Made basic/piercing shotgun pellets one damage weaker.
    - Made basic slugs fire 3, and piercing  slugs fire 2.
    - Added a better chain for vanadium oxide unlocked in metalloids.
    - Added subgroups for coolants, lubricants and solid fuel recipes. yes we have that many.
    - Added elevated rail comptability.
    - Affected the trout population by 1%.
    - Added a subgroup for sulfuric acid, and split sulfur into its own subgroup.
    - Added an early sulfuric acid recipe in place of the removed acidic water > sulfuric acid chain. It is unlocked after mixing tanks, and unlocks certain previously sulfuric-locked things (like platinum).
    - introduced hot coolant! currently it is only produced by reactors (and some recipes), where it has to be cooled back down to be usable, losing a little in the process.
    - Added urhlumin in AEM packs, which is an advanced alloy and can be used to create coil heaters which act like beacons for furnaces.
    - Titanium oxide now has a fluxed recipe!

    - Changed CRT's recipe to take CRT framing and screens.
